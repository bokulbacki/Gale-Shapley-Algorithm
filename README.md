# Gale-Shapley-Algorithm 

In Colaboration with @benberube
Implementation of a popular stable-matching algorithm which produces an array containing a matching between two input sets. Program runs in O(n^2) time, utilizing dictionaries and queues to access data structures in constant time. Sample input and solution files are included.   

The extensions of the
basic version of the problem are:
1. Each hospital can have any number of positions, not necessarily all the same.
2. A hospital can find some students unacceptable, and a student can find some
hospitals unacceptable.
3. There can be an unequal number of available positions and students.


SAMPLE INPUT STRUCTURE:
num_hospitals num_students
num_positions_0 num_positions_1 ...
hospital 0 preferences
hospital 1 preferences
hospital 1 preferences

student 0 preferences
